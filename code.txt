To check the relationship or correlation between a categorical column (1–36) and a continuous column, you can use both statistical tests and visualization techniques.

1. Statistical Methods

A. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

Tests if the means of the continuous variable differ significantly across the 36 categories.

import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

# Assuming df is your DataFrame, 'category' is your categorical column, and 'value' is your continuous column
anova_result = stats.f_oneway(*(df[df['category'] == cat]['value'] for cat in df['category'].unique()))
print("F-statistic:", anova_result.statistic)
print("p-value:", anova_result.pvalue)

Interpretation:

A low p-value (< 0.05) suggests that at least one category has a different mean, implying a potential correlation.



---

B. Eta-Squared (Effect Size)

Measures how much of the variance in the continuous variable is explained by the categorical variable.

from statsmodels.formula.api import ols
import statsmodels.api as sm

model = ols('value ~ C(category)', data=df).fit()
anova_table = sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)
eta_squared = anova_table['sum_sq']['C(category)'] / anova_table['sum_sq'].sum()
print("Eta Squared:", eta_squared)

Interpretation:

0.01: small effect, 0.06: medium, 0.14: large effect.

2. Visualization Methods

A. Boxplot

Displays distribution of the continuous variable across categories.

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(14,6))
sns.boxplot(x='category', y='value', data=df)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title("Boxplot of Value by Category")
plt.show()

Interpretation:

Look for visible differences in medians and spread across categories.



---

B. Violin Plot

Combines KDE and boxplot.

plt.figure(figsize=(14,6))
sns.violinplot(x='category', y='value', data=df, inner="quartile")
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title("Violin Plot of Value by Category")
plt.show()


---

C. Strip Plot or Swarm Plot

Visualizes all points.

plt.figure(figsize=(14,6))
sns.stripplot(x='category', y='value', data=df, jitter=True, alpha=0.5)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title("Strip Plot of Value by Category")
plt.show()


---

Bonus: Encoding and Correlation (not recommended for ordered categoricals without ordinal meaning)

You can encode categories as integers (1–36) and compute Pearson or Spearman correlation, but only if the numeric codes have true ordinal meaning, which seems unlikely in your case.


---

Recommendation

Use ANOVA + Eta-Squared to test for statistical correlation.

Use boxplots or violin plots for visual exploration.
