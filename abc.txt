Hi Team,

I have faced EPR issue last year and I have pointed it out multiple time and even tried to reached to manager/ HC people. Last year I didn't receive the EPR for one quarter. I joined Telstra account from 1'st June 2023. My profile was kept blocked, but because of some changes at client side in their leadership, they released me in August, 2023. When asked for EPR I was told that as there was no work assigned, they didn't submit any EPR. I was assured that this won't impact my growth at Fractal but I am facing serious consequence of it now and I am unable to explore growth in orgnization.

I had completed my all trainings and certification. I have received good feedback from previous clients I worked for. From my side I always put my efforts for orgnization's growth. I was elegible in last Oct'23 promotional cycle but my reporting manager missed to nominate me. In April'24 cycle, I was not sure whether being nominated or not but after lots of followups from RM and HC I got feedback that I didn't receive the promotion.

As I checked, my GA score is 79.40% for last year. It is drastically impacted by EPR and billing issue caused. Though, I have completed 3+ years with Fractal and having good feedback/ appreceation from other clients for which I worked for I am not elegible for promotion. I feel very much disappointed as my growth is stucked because because of things which are not in my controls. 

Thanks and Regards,
Amit Mane
